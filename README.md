# Solana Bandwidth Markets (SBM)

## Overview

**Solana Bandwidth Markets (SBM)** is a decentralized protocol that creates a peer-to-peer marketplace for bandwidth on the Solana blockchain. It enables validators and RPC providers to rent out unused bandwidth, and allows dApps, traders, and other consumers to purchase guaranteed bandwidth for priority transactions. SBM leverages Solana’s high throughput, parallel execution, and low fees to efficiently manage micro-auctions for bandwidth slots.

---

## Why SBM?

- **Solana’s performance** depends on high-bandwidth, low-latency nodes.
- **Bandwidth is often underutilized** or bottlenecked during peak times.
- **SBM creates a market** where:
  - Validators/RPC nodes can monetize unused bandwidth.
  - Consumers can buy guaranteed bandwidth for time-sensitive operations.
- **Result:** Reduces validator congestion, incentivizes high-performance nodes, and enables “priority lanes” for dApps (e.g., gaming, DeFi).

---

## Key Innovations

- **DePIN Meets DeFi:** Bandwidth becomes a tradable commodity via tokenized contracts (compressed NFTs for bandwidth slots).
- **Parallel Fee Markets:** Auctions for bandwidth run in parallel, leveraging Solana’s Sealevel runtime.
- **Proof of Bandwidth (PoB):** Light clients verify bandwidth delivery, with fraud proofs possible via oracles.
- **Compressed NFTs:** Bandwidth leases are represented as low-cost, high-volume NFTs.

## Protocol Architecture

### 1. On-Chain (Anchor Program)

#### **BandwidthSlot Account**

- Represents a bandwidth offer from a validator.
- Fields:
  - `validator`: Pubkey of the validator/RPC node.
  - `speed_mbps`: Offered bandwidth (e.g., 100 Mbps).
  - `start_time`: When the slot becomes active.
  - `auction_end_time`: When bidding ends.
  - `min_bid`: Minimum bid required.
  - `winning_bid`: Highest bid (if any).
  - `winner`: Pubkey of the winning bidder (if any).
  - `closed`: Whether the auction is closed.
  - `claimed`: Whether the validator has claimed the funds.

#### **Escrow PDA**

- Each auction has a unique Program Derived Address (PDA) escrow account.
- All bid funds are held in the escrow PDA until the auction is closed and claimed.

#### **Instructions**

- `list_bandwidth`: Validator lists a new bandwidth slot for auction.
- `bid`: Consumer places a bid. If outbidding, the previous highest bidder is refunded.
- `close_auction`: Validator closes the auction after the end time.
- `claim_funds`: Validator claims the winning bid from the escrow PDA.

#### **Events**

- Emitted for listing, bidding, auction closing, and funds claiming for off-chain indexing.

### 2. Off-Chain (Client)

#### **Proof of Bandwidth (PoB)**

- Light client pings validator endpoints to verify bandwidth and latency.
- Optionally, submits fraud proofs to the program (future extension).

#### **Frontend**

- dApps and users can:
  - List available bandwidth slots.
  - Place bids.
  - View owned bandwidth NFTs.
  - Track auction status and history.

## How It Works

1. **Listing:**  
   Validators/RPC providers list available bandwidth slots, specifying speed, start time, duration, and minimum bid.

2. **Bidding:**  
   Consumers (dApps, traders, etc.) place bids on slots. If outbid, the previous bidder is refunded automatically.

3. **Auction Close:**  
   After the auction end time, the validator closes the auction. The highest bidder wins the slot.

4. **Claiming Funds:**  
   The validator claims the winning bid from the escrow PDA.

5. **Bandwidth Delivery:**  
   Off-chain, the winner receives access to the validator’s bandwidth for the specified period. PoB clients can verify delivery.

6. **NFT Representation:**  
   Winning bidders may receive a compressed NFT representing their bandwidth lease (future extension).

## Why Solana?

- **No mempool:** Priority bandwidth means transactions skip the queue.
- **Sealevel:** Parallel processing for thousands of bandwidth auctions.
- **Low fees:** Enables micropayments for hourly/daily leases.
- **Compressed NFTs:** Efficient, low-cost representation of bandwidth rights.

---

## Judging Criteria Fit

- **Impact:** Directly boosts Solana’s scalability and adoption.
- **Solution:** Clever use of existing infra (no novel consensus needed).
- **Completeness:** MVP includes auction contract, escrow logic, and frontend.
- **Users:** Target validators/RPC providers and dApps needing priority bandwidth.

## Example: BandwidthSlot Data Structure

```rust
struct BandwidthSlot {
  validator: Pubkey,
  speed_mbps: u64,
  start_time: i64,
  auction_end_time: i64,
  min_bid: u64,
  winning_bid: Option<u64>,
  winner: Option<Pubkey>,
  closed: bool,
  claimed: bool,
}
```

## How to Run (MVP)

1. **Deploy the Anchor program to localnet or devnet.**
2. **Use the provided test suite to simulate:**
   - Listing a slot
   - Bidding (with outbidding/refund)
   - Closing the auction
   - Claiming funds
3. **(Optional) Build a simple frontend to interact with the protocol.**

## Future Extensions

- **Compressed NFT minting for bandwidth leases.**
- **Automated PoB verification and fraud proofs.**
- **Integration with Solana RPC/Web3.js for bandwidth-prioritized transactions.**
- **Marketplace UI for bandwidth trading.**
